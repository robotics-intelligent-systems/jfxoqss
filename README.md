# Open Quantum Systems Simulation

Avalon is a programming language aimed at a specific class of quantum computers called classical-quantum hybrid quantum computers. A hybrid classical-quantum computer has the property of having a classical computer driving (telling) the quantum computer what to do. These computers are being built by IBM and Rigetti and Avalon seeks to target both, starting with Rigetti.
