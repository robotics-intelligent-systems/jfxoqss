# Open Quantum Systems Simulation

Quantum4J brings quantum programming to Java with a full Quantum Software Engineering stack — circuits, simulators, compiler passes, QASM support, and enterprise-grade extensibility. Jaq is a Quantum computing engine. QuISL (Quantum Information Science Library). The Quantum Exact Simulation Toolkit (QuEST) is a high-performance simulator of quantum statevectors and density matrices. It hybridises multithreading, GPU acceleration and distribution to run lightning fast on laptops, desktops and supercomputers, parallelising over multiple cores, CPUs and GPUs. Behind the scenes, QuEST leverages OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, HIP, Thrust, cuQuantum and GPUDirect for cutting-edge performance on modern multi-GPU clusters, and compatibility with older NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. These deployments can be combined in any combination, or automatically decided at runtime, yet are abstracted behind a single, seamless interface, accessible by both C and C++ and all the major compilers. QX simulator is a simulator of cQASM programs. OpenSATQKD, a framework for modeling and evaluating satellite QKD missions. Avalon is a programming language aimed at a specific class of quantum computers called classical-quantum hybrid quantum computers. A hybrid classical-quantum computer has the property of having a classical computer driving (telling) the quantum computer what to do. These computers are being built by IBM and Rigetti and Avalon seeks to target both, starting with Rigetti. Cirq is a Python software library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum circuits, and then running them on quantum computers and quantum simulators. The CUDA-Q Platform for hybrid quantum-classical computers enables integration and programming of quantum processing units (QPUs), GPUs, and CPUs in one system. Microsoft Quantum Development Kit, including the Q# programming language, resource estimator, and Quantum Katas
