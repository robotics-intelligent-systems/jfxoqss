# Open Quantum Systems Simulation

The azure-quantum python package submits jobs to the Azure Quantum service. Strange is a Quantum Computing API and simulator for Java. Open Quantum Toolchain for OPerators & USers (OQTOPUS) is a project that provides the architecture of cloud quantum computers as an open-source software (OSS). Quantum4J brings quantum programming to Java with a full Quantum Software Engineering stack — circuits, simulators, compiler passes, QASM support, and enterprise-grade extensibility. Jaq is a Quantum computing engine. QuISL (Quantum Information Science Library). The Quantum Exact Simulation Toolkit (QuEST) is a high-performance simulator of quantum statevectors and density matrices. Intel Quantum Simulator (Intel-QS), also known as qHiPSTER (The Quantum High Performance Software Testing Environment), is a simulator of quantum circuits optimized to take maximum advantage of multi-core and multi-nodes architectures. QX simulator is a simulator of cQASM programs. OpenSATQKD, a framework for modeling and evaluating satellite QKD missions. Avalon is a programming language aimed at a specific class of quantum computers called classical-quantum hybrid quantum computers. A hybrid classical-quantum computer has the property of having a classical computer driving (telling) the quantum computer what to do. These computers are being built by IBM and Rigetti and Avalon seeks to target both, starting with Rigetti. Cirq is a Python software library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum circuits, and then running them on quantum computers and quantum simulators. The CUDA-Q Platform for hybrid quantum-classical computers enables integration and programming of quantum processing units (QPUs), GPUs, and CPUs in one system. Microsoft Quantum Development Kit, including the Q# programming language, resource estimator, and Quantum Katas. Qiskit is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of extended quantum circuits, operators, and primitives.
