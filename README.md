# Open Quantum Systems Simulation

In physics, an open quantum system is a quantum mechanical system that interacts with an external quantum system, known as the environment or a bath. In general, these interactions significantly change the dynamics of the system, such that the information contained in the system is lost to its environment. Because no quantum system is completely isolated from its surroundings, it is important to develop a theoretical framework for treating these interactions to obtain an accurate understanding of quantum systems.
